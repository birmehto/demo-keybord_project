## Introduction

This feature enhancement focuses on improving the user experience in the web general sales form by implementing proper focus node management, auto-focus functionality, and ensuring all form fields work correctly. The goal is to create a smooth, keyboard-friendly interface that guides users through the sales entry process efficiently.

3. WHEN a user changes the payment method to "Cash" THEN the system SHALL show the cash received field and auto-populate it with the net amount
4. WHEN a user changes the payment method from "Cash" to another method THEN the system SHALL hide the cash received field and clear its value
5. WHEN calculations are updated THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect changes in all summary boxes

### Requirement 4
